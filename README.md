# INeuBytes Data Science Internship - August 2023

Welcome to my Data Science Internship repository with IneuBytes, where I've documented my journey in the field of data science during the August 2023 internship. This repository showcases my work on three exciting datasets, each involving data cleaning, data visualization, and the development of machine learning models.

## Datasets and Projects

### 1. Heart Disease Prediction

**Dataset:** Heart Disease Dataset

In this project, I worked on predicting whether a patient is suffering from heart disease using various machine learning models. I conducted data cleaning, explored the data through visualization, and implemented predictive models to assist in heart disease diagnosis.

### 2. Air Pollution Analysis

**Dataset:** Air Pollution Dataset (Pm2.5)

In the Air Pollution Analysis project, I focused on studying the levels of Pm2.5 in the air. Through data preprocessing and visualization, I gained insights into air quality trends and pollution levels, contributing to environmental awareness.

### 3. Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation

**Dataset:** Customer Segmentation Dataset

This project involved predictive analysis and customer segmentation. I cleaned and prepared the data, visualized customer behavior, and developed segmentation models to help understand and target different customer groups effectively.

## Repository Structure

- `/Heart-disease-prediction`: Contains code and notebooks for the Heart Disease Prediction project.
- `/air-pollution-analysis`: Includes code and notebooks for the Air Pollution Analysis project.
- `/customer-segmentation`: Holds code and notebooks for the Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation project.
